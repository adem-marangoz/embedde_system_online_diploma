## In This Lessoned machine in the theory of computation whose output values are determined by both its current state and current inputs.


It is divided into three sections :
---
**Moore**
<br>**Mealy**
<br>**State machine**<br>

----
<br>**We used the TTool program to draw a topological state machine.**

---
<br>**We wrote a program to measure distance and acceleration in C language, for example, using a state machine topology**
